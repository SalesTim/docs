## Inputs
Provisioning jobs execution could be triggered from the following events:
- An end-user is requesting the creation of a new team from a Microsoft Teams client.
- An external system (Custom application, Power Aotomate...) is using nBold's API to request the creation of a new team.

## Pre-processing
During the pre-processing phase, the provisioning job executes controls to make sure that the appropriate configuration has been defined, and that everything is ready for the processing step:
- Controls if the security context gives access to the source team defined in the collaboration template
- Controls if the source team is not archived (as due to a Microsoft Graph bug, it denies access to some settings and contents of the team)
- Controls the structure and contents that have to be cloned as defined in the template
- Controls if the required information are available to apply the naming convention for the team name, team description, email address and welcome message
- Define the appropriate language to be used for end-user notifications
- If an approval is required by the template, triggers the approval job instead of running the provisioning.

## Processing
During the processing phase, the job provisions a new team and all the associated contents:
- Create a group with the appropriate geo (based on the requester PDL or based on a dynamic rule based on the template / requester profile)
- Create a team from the previously created group (aka "teamsify")
- Apply team privacy (public / private)
- Apply the email convention to the underlying group email alias
- Apply sensitivity labels to the underlying group
- Update team picture from the source team
- Clone files and folders from the source team to the newly created one
- Install all the required apps associated with tabs from the source team
- Configure and all the tabs and provision their content if it is supported by the associated app

:::tip Note
Depending on the configuration defined from the `Settings` tab, the provisioning job could be executed in the security context of:
- A registered service account. In this context, the provisioning job uses the permissions defined in the [Service account scope](/trust-center/microsoft-graph-permissions.md#service-account-scope).
- An Azure AD registered app. In this context, the provisioning job uses the permissions defined in the [Application scope](/trust-center/microsoft-graph-permissions.md#application-scope).
:::

## Post-processing
During the processing phase, once the team structure and contents are fully provisioned, the job invites the required users to both the team and its channels:
- Invite the requester to the team, as a member / owner depending on the template configuration
- Invite members and owners requested by the requester to the team
- Invite permanent members and owners defined in the template to the team
- Invite the requester as a member / owner to every private and shared channels, depending on the template configuration
- Invite members and owners requested by the requester to every private and shared channels
- Invite permanent members and owners defined in the template to every private and shared channels

## Outputs
During the different phases, the provisioning job generates events that are handled by two different modules:
- The audit trails module creates a new record for each event
- The notification module send a notification in the `general` channel of the created team

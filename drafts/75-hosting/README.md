# Self-Hosting
This documentation describes how to host our platform on your own servers or in your cloud environment, and manage your own infrastructure (installation, maintenance, upgrades, server capacity, uptime, backup and so on).

This is different from [nBold Cloud](https://nbold.co) where we manage everything for your ease and convenience. Take a look at the [differences between nBold Cloud and Self-Hosted](./cloud-vs-self-hosted.md).

**To get started easily, please read our [Setup Guide](./installation/README.md).**

*Happy hosting!*

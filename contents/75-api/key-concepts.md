    # Key concepts

    ## Templates
    Templates are at the core of the nBold platform. As a rule of thumb, templates are a combination of two elements:
    - A team template, describing the structure and contents of a team.
    - A governance policy that may include security and compliance rules.

    A template may be created by yourself and saved in your private corporate catalog for internal use. We call this kind of template `Catalog Template`.

    See [How to create a new template](/collaboration-templates/create-a-new-collaboration-template).
    
    ## Corporate Catalog
    The corporate catalog contains your own private templates, accessible to your end-users, that includes your custom governance policies, such as:
    - Naming conventions
    - Audience targeting
    - Approval rules
    - Security automation
    - Sensitivity labels

    ## Jobs
    Jobs are governance tasks executed by the nBold Platform automation engine. They can be requested by the nBold administrators, catalog managers and virtual apps, to perform powerful operations such as:
    - Provision a new team based on a template
    - Apply governance policies to multiple teams
    - Automatically archive teams based on a specific rule

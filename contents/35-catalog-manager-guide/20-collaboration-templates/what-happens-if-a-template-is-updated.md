# What happens if a collaboration template is updated?

We always have this question:

> what if I change the Microsoft Teams Template, will it change all the Teams already created with this Template?

When you [build a Collaboration Template with nBold](/catalog-manager-guide/collaboration-templates/create-a-new-collaboration-template) there are two main parts: the original team that will be replicated and the associated governance policies. When a change is made to one of these two pieces, here is what won't affect or will affect the formerly created teams linked to the Template:

Will change for the Teams created **in the past** and **in the future**:

* [Enforced Teams Privacy](/catalog-manager-guide/governance-policies/security-policy)
* [Permanent Members and Permanent Owners](/catalog-manager-guide/governance-policies/permanent-owners-and-members-policy)

Will change for the Teams created **in the future**:

* Standard Channels Cloning
* Tabs Cloning
* [Files Tabs](/catalog-manager-guide/collaboration-templates/files-and-folders) Cloning with Files and Folders in each standard channel
* [Planner](/catalog-manager-guide/collaboration-templates/microsoft-planner) Tabs with Buckets, Tasks, Description, Checklist and Label
* Website Tabs
* [Forms Tabs](/catalog-manager-guide/collaboration-templates/microsoft-forms)
* [Office Files Tabs](/catalog-manager-guide/collaboration-templates/office-and-pdf-documents)
* [SharePoint Online Document Library](/catalog-manager-guide/collaboration-templates/sharepoint-library)
* [Naming Convention](/catalog-manager-guide/governance-policies/naming-conventions)
* [Audience Targeting](/catalog-manager-guide/governance-policies/audience-targeting)
* Teams Creation Requester Membership Policy
* [Minimum Number of Owner and Members](/catalog-manager-guide/governance-policies/mandatory-number-of-owners-and-members)
* [Sensitivity Label](/catalog-manager-guide/governance-policies/sensitivity-labels)

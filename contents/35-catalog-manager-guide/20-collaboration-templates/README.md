# Collaboration Templates

Collaboration Templates are pre-built workspaces with all the necessary information that a team needs to work together efficiently.
You can customize your workspace by integrating and pre-configuring any tool that you use, so your team can work on them directly without the need to juggle between apps.

Through collaboration templates, you can make a customized playbook for any business process and then replicate the rest of the collaboration spaces that you or your team need with this template. This not only saves time but also makes the entire process of collaboration easier, faster, and most importantly, more productive.

Now, let's get started!

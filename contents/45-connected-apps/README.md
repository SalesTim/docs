## Deal Room Solutions with Connected Apps using nBold

**What is Deal Room?**

Deal Room is a digital workspace that incorporates all the tools, documentation, and data necessary to work on closing deals.  
If you're using both Microsoft Teams and Salesforce / HubSpot, Deal Rooms will ensure smooth and automatic information flow and bridge the communication gap between the users of both platforms.

The Deal Room with connected Apps (Salesforce/HubSpot) solution allows you to:

* Get teams automatically created from your own collaboration templates for each new deal reaching your setup filters
* Define the ownership of the created team and sync it to the deal owner in the connected Apps
* Manage the end of life for a team once the deal is closed (Delete/Archive/Rename)
* Communicate deal stage or amount changes to specific management teams or channels

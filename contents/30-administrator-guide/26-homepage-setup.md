Employees will get a home page that gathers all the Teams she/he belongs to, and where they can create teams based on templates made available by your organization.

:::tip You can make this homepage available to everyone in your organization or just certain groups of people.

## Setup

* Deploy the Home Page for a selected group of users: jump directly to step 5

### 4. Deploy the Home package for everyone

You'll see two policies by default, but it may vary depending on your own configuration. With App Setup Policies, you have the capability to change the Apps shown to end-users on the left bar.

Select the `Global (Org Wide Default)` policy:

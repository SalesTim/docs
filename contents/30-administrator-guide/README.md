## Collaboration Templates Catalog

## View and Manage all the Teams templates

The "Catalog" gathers all the Templates defined for your organization. You can manage your Corporate Catalog of Collaboration Templates. These Templates enable you to ensure a strong Teamwork adoption and set up a differentiated Governance at the template level.

First, you'll find this tab with all the existing Templates for your organization:

During setup, a "Default team" Template has been provisioned. You cannot delete the "Default Team" Template. If you don't want to use it, just disable it from the main "Information" tab.

## Manage your Collaboration Templates

For each existing Template, you can Enable or Disable it for users:

N.B : To edit an existing Template, just click on its name from the list. The edit form is similar to the creation form.

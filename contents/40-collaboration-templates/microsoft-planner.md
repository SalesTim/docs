# Full fidelity Planner cloning in Microsoft Teams

How to clone Planner plans as part of Collaboration templates

After tremendous efforts, we reached a new milestone in our provisioning engine. Now you can clone your 📅 Planner tasks across Collaboration templates, with **full parity** between the original one and the cloned plan!

What do we mean by full fidelity? Here are the elements that will be cloned from your source plan:

* 📅 Plan name
* 🗃 Buckets (including order)
* ✅ Tasks (including order)
* 🏷 Labels

For each task, here are the elements that are cloned:

* ✅ Task name
* 🗃 Bucket
* 📝 Notes
* ✔✔✔ Checklist items (aka sub-tasks)
* 🏷 Labels (aka colored tags)

For now, we decided not to clone "Progress", "Priority", "Start date", "End date" and "Attachments", as they may vary from one team to another, but if you have specific use cases or requirements, 🙏🏼 please share them with us by 💬 chat.

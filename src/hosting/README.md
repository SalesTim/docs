# nBold Self-Hosted

This documentation is for hosting our platform on your own servers and managing your own infrastructure (installation, maintenance, upgrades, server capacity, uptime, backup and so on).

This is different from [nBold Cloud](https://nbold.co) where we manage everything for your ease and convenience. Take a look at the [differences between nBold Cloud and Self-Hosted](./references/self_hosted_cloud_comparison).

**To get started easily, please read our [Getting Started Guide](/hosting/installation/get-started.md).**

*Happy hosting!*

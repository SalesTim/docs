2. Add the different Channels you want.
3. Add files and folders in Files Tab
4. Add the different Website tabs to refer to any Intranet Page, Website or WebApp Application (must be in _https://_)
5. Add Planner in the relevant channels with Predefined Tasks, Checklist, Description, Labels and Buckets

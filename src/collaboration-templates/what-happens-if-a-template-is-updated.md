# What happens if a template is updated?

We always have this question:

> what if I change the Microsoft Teams Template, will it change all the Teams already created with this Template?

When you [build a Collaboration Template with nBold](/collaboration-templates/create-a-new-collaboration-template) there are two main parts: the original team that will be replicated and the associated governance policies. When a change is made to one of these two pieces, here is what won't affect or will affect the formerly created teams linked to the Template:

Will change for the Teams created **in the past** and **in the future**:

* [Enforced Teams Privacy](/governance-policies/security-policy)
* [Permanent Members and Permanent Owners](/governance-policies/permanent-owners-and-members-policy)

Will change for the Teams created **in the future**:

* Standard Channels Cloning
* Tabs Cloning
* Files Tabs Cloning with Files and Folders in each channel
* Planner Tabs with Buckets, Tasks, Description, Checklist and Label
* Website Tabs
* Forms Tabs
* Office Files Tabs
* SharePoint Online Document Library
* Naming Convention
* Audience Targeting
* Teams Creation Requester Membership Policy

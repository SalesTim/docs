# What happens if a collaboration template is updated?

We always have this question:

> what if I change the Microsoft Teams Template, will it change all the Teams already created with this Template?

When you [build a Collaboration Template with nBold](/collaboration-templates/create-a-new-collaboration-template.md) there are two main parts: the original team that will be replicated and the associated governance policies. When a change is made to one of these two pieces, here is what won't affect or will affect the formerly created teams linked to the Template:

Will change for the Teams created **in the past** and **in the future**:

* [Enforced Teams Privacy](/governance-policies/security-policy.md)
* [Permanent Members and Permanent Owners](/governance-policies/permanent-owners-and-members-policy.md)

Will change for the Teams created **in the future**:

* Standard Channels Cloning
* Tabs Cloning
* [Files Tabs](https://docs.nbold.co/collaboration-templates/files-and-folders.html) Cloning with Files and Folders in each standard channel
* [Planner](https://docs.nbold.co/collaboration-templates/microsoft-planner.html) Tabs with Buckets, Tasks, Description, Checklist and Label
* Website Tabs
* [Forms Tabs](https://docs.nbold.co/collaboration-templates/microsoft-forms.html)
* [Office Files Tabs](https://docs.nbold.co/collaboration-templates/office-and-pdf-documents.html)
* [SharePoint Online Document Library](https://docs.nbold.co/collaboration-templates/sharepoint-library.html)
* [Naming Convention](https://docs.nbold.co/governance-policies/naming-conventions.html)
* [Audience Targeting](https://docs.nbold.co/governance-policies/audience-targeting.html)
* Teams Creation Requester Membership Policy
* [Minimum Number of Owner and Members](https://docs.nbold.co/governance-policies/mandatory-number-of-owners-and-members.html)
* [Sensitivity Label](https://docs.nbold.co/governance-policies/sensitivity-labels.html)

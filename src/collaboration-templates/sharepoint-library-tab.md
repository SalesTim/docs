How to clone SharePoint libraries and Office documents as part of Collaboration templates.

  
What if you want to want to bring reference documents and materials that are stored in a SharePoint library to every project management team created in your organization?  
Now you can deploy SharePoint libraries and Office documents at scale in your organization through Collaboration templates!  
To include your content, just add a new tab in your template team:

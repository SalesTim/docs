# Delegate your template catalog administration

You don't need to be a Microsoft 365 Global Administrator to create, manage and delete templates. Any user from your Microsoft Teams environment can be granted with the `Catalog Manager` role.

> It's easy as 1-2-3!

**1.** As a Microsoft 365 Administrator, connect to the nBold app, open the `Settings` tab, and navigate to the `RBAC` section:

**2.** From the `Catalog Managers` field, search for users with their name or email:

**3.** Click `Save`:

> That's it!

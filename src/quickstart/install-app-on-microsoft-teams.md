## 1. Get the nBold app

Get nBold through the [Microsoft Teams Apps Store](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/589748de-ec98-4616-9063-e91c629bd1a4?source=store-copy-link).

***

## 2. Connect to Microsoft Teams as a Global Admin

Connect to Microsoft Teams with a Global Admin account. Otherwise, you won't be able to implement the app in the organization.

Select your Office 365 account (you must be a Global Admin) and enter your password. Read the permissions, **check the box "Consent on behalf of your organization" and click "Accept".**

1. nBold _doesn't support personal Microsoft Accounts (for instance @outlook.com, @hotmail.com...). You must use a valid Office 365 account from your organization that is a Global Admin_

You see, it was quick! You're all set up.

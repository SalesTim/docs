**Microsoft Teams Apps SSO support is here**

No more Sign-in! ðŸ‘Œ

Now nBold supports the Microsoft Teams App SSO capability, meaning that users are not anymore required to click on the sign-in button, the sign in is done automatically!

To get this new benefit you would need [to update the Home Package](https://help.salestim.com/en/articles/3618052-update-app-packages) on your tenant. For the SalesTim App, this will arrive in the next few days, as this is Microsoft who will publish the updated version of the nBold App.

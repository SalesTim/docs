## Step 1: Create the Original Team of the Collaboration Template

1\. **Create a new team** using the regular way, from "Join or Create Team" in Teams.

2\. **Name it** "Project Management - Template" for example.

3\. **Add the different channels**, here is a suggested list:

* üí∞ Budget

* üìä Steering Committee

4\. **Add Websites Tabs** in every channel needed, you can bring any content that comes with a URL to the Team created. The content can be any information that you would like to share with your team members.

3\. **In the Info tab**, fill in the name of the original team which is named "Project Management - Template" Microsoft Team name and description. You also have the ability to choose the desired Microsoft Teams Template language.

4\. **In the Name Tab,** set up the name of the Team that will be created from the Template:

* **Default Team Name** (what user will fill in the request form): this can be the _Name of the Project_
* **Naming Convention** (the name automatically generated): this can be _<%=_ [_request.team.name_](http://request.team.name/) _%> - Project_
* **Default Teams description:** Enter Additional Project Description
* **Business Solution Description:** this can be _Team dedicated to collaborate around the Project: <%=_ [_request.team.name_](http://request.team.name/) _%> | Location: <%= user.msCountry %> | Created by: <%=_ [_request.request.requester.name_](http://request.request.requester.name/) _%> with the job role: <%= user.msJobTitle%> | <%= request.team.description %>_

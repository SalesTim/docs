## Targeted Release

### Benefits
Targeted release allows admins, change managers, or anyone else responsible for nBold updates to prepare for the upcoming changes by letting them:
- Test and validate new updates before they are released to all the users in the organization.
- Prepare user notification and documentation before updates are released.
- Prepare internal help-desk for upcoming changes.
- Go through compliance and security reviews.
- Use feature controls, where applicable, to control the release of updates to end users.

### Setup
Access to targeted release is controlled by an [RBAC](/trust-center/role-based-access-control.md) policy. To grant a user access to targeted release features:
1. Open the `Settings` tab
2. Open the `Roles (RBAC)` section
3. Assign the `Change Manager` role to the user
4. Click `Save`

## Validation Rings

Our release process is comprised of multiple "rings" of validation that are related to specific environments, to a specific audience and a specific compliance labeling level:

| Ring | Environments | Primary Audience | Purpose |
|:-------:|--------------|------------------|---------|
| **4** | **production** | Customers (All) | Obvious isn't it? ;-) |
| **3.5** | **staging** | DevOps Team | Test automated deployments and upgrades in an iso-production environment |
| **3** | **beta** | Customers (Preview) | Preview environment designed to help some customers prepare for updates, from a technical and change management standpoint |
| **2** | **uat** | Product Team | The product team tests the app to verify whether it meets their expectations |
| **1.5** | **alpha** | Partners (SI/ISV) | Give strategic partners an early look at the features we're currently working on |
| **1** | **dogfood** | Internal | Internal [Dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) |
| **0** | **integration** | DevOps Team | Integrations and functional testing by the tech team |

Using this kind of rings has many advantages:
* Clear and common understanding of each ring purpose
* Separation of concerns
* Real isolation between environments
* Enforced security


## Versioning Strategy

Our versioning strategy adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).  
A version number may be comprised of 3 to 4 components and takes this form:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-BUILD
```

Meaning of each component:
* MAJOR: version that includes incompatible changes (data schema, api signatures...)
* MINOR: version that includes functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
* PATCH: version that includes backwards-compatible bug fixes
* BUILD: incremental development-only version

## Authentication

### Identity Provider (IdP)
Access to nBold relies 100% on Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AAD) as an IdP for authentication.  
Especially, it means that:
- User authentication is performed against your own AAD, just like any other regular Office 365 authentication process.
- You can enable, disable and manage individual permissions grants from your own AAD.
- We're not accessing, processing nor storing any login / password.
- Our authentication mechanism is compatible with any [MFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) authentication method supported by AAD.

### Single Sign On (SSO)

Single Sign On (SSO) for Microsoft Teams custom apps such as nBold is not yet fully supported by Microsoft, as the current implementation for SSO only grants consent for user-level permissions (email, profile, offline_access, openid) but not for other APIs (such as Microsoft Graph).  
For further reference, see [Microsoft Teams SSO for custom apps known limitations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/how-to/authentication/auth-aad-sso#known-limitations)

## Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

Role based access control (RBAC) enables Microsoft 365 global administrators to define permissions and restrict access to specific nBold's features to specific groups of users.

To implement RBAC and provide a high level of granularity, nBold relies on both standard Microsoft 365 roles, namely `Teams service admin` and `Global admin`, and also on some application specific roles, such as `Catalog managers` and `Integration manager`.

### Supported roles
The nBold platform supports the following roles:

| Role | Code | Origin |
|------|------|--------|
| End-User | `AUTHENTICATED_USER` | nBold |
| Authorized App | `AUTHORIZED_APP` | nBold |
| Catalog Manager | `CATALOG_MANAGER` | nBold |
| Integration Manager | `INTEGRATION_MANAGER` | nBold |
| Change Manager | `CHANGE_MANAGER` | nBold |
| Teams Service Admin | `TEAMS_SERVICE_ADMIN` | Microsoft 365 |
| Global Admin | `GLOBAL_ADMIN` | Microsoft 365 |

### Roles Permissions
Here is the matrix of features/roles supported by the nBold platform:

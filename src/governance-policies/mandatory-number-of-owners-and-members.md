# **Mandatory Number of Owners and Members at teams Creation**

When teams are created, many are created with only 1 owner or maybe with no members. And we all know the problems coming with the situation where the only owner is quitting the company: Orphan Teams!

While you can rely on the [Permanent Owners and Members policy](https://help.salestim.com/en/articles/4149874-permanent-owners-and-members-policy) to address this, there are some use cases where it doesn't make sense to have a permanent owner or member in the team created.

Especially in a high scale motion, you need to ensure that there are several owners and/or members in a team but you can't assume who that can be.

For all these reasons, we're introducing the capability called "Mandatory Owners and Members", which lets you add a policy to make sure you have the right number of Owners and Members when the team is being created.

Here is how it works ðŸ‘‡

The Catalog Admin Experience:

As an admin on the Catalog tab, in the template settings at the Security tab, you have the policy to define a minim number of Owners and Members to add when a team is being created by a user.

From the end-user perspective, if you don't enter the required number of owners and members, you're prompted with a message to comply with the policy.

You can select up to 20 Mandatory Owners and Members for each template.

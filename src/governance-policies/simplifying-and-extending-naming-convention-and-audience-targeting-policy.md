# **Simplifying and Extending Naming Convention and Audience Targeting Policy**

This article describes how to implement powerful naming conventions for your teams and push teams templates to specific audiences.

Since we launched nBold, you had the ability to build advanced Naming Convention and Audience Targeting rules at the template level. Most of our customers are seeing a lot of value in this flexible way to build advanced Collaboration Governance capabilities.

Today, we're announcing a new and effortless way to build those rules using Tags, in addition to the support of Active Directory custom attributes.

# **Naming Convention**

From each of your Dynamic Naming Conventions fields, you're now able to add any attribute by simply typing "@" and you'll be suggested with all supported attributes (you can also search for them by typing the beginning of the tag name).

So, in a few seconds, you just build an advanced Naming Policy for your Collaboration Templates!

Also, at the bottom of the list you'll be able to add any custom attribute from your Active Directory.

# **Audience Targeting**

Similarly, you now can use any of these attributes to build your audience targeting rules. You can follow the [tech documentation to learn more](https://docs.nbold.co/governance-policies/audience-targeting.html) to learn how to write them.
